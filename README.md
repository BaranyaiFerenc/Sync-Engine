## Sync-Engine
3D engine that provides fast 3D rendering with low resulotion

## Dependencies
The code uses basic libraries like:
-`iostream`: input and output
-`time`: timing and logging

The code also uses the `SFML` graphic library for the window and display


## Basic files
-'main.cpp': The main loop runs here
-'vector.h / Vector.cpp': Contains the 'Vector', 'Rotation' and 'Face' classes
-'matrix.hpp': Contains the 'Matrix' class that makes the matrix multiplication easier for the projection calculations
-'dictionary.hpp': Contains the 'Dictionary' class that enables to store key and itam pairs in a list
-'binarytree.hpp': BinaryTree class that can store big data and have the possibility to search them fast
-'list.hpp': Contains the chained 'List' class
-'string.hpp': Custom 'String' class that uses chained list for storing character arrays
-'logger.hpp': Custom Logger class that can make advenced logs on console and also in files
